This repository is the **Machine Learning** projects I did.

1. Graphene Kirigami

Making 3 dimensional structures using 2-dimensional graphene sheets with kirigami-like cutting techniques are an efficient way to create stretchable materials [1] (https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14588). Yet, as 3 dimensional shapes get more complex and bigger in size, it is relatively hard to find the proper and the most efficient cutting patterns. It has been studied that using machine learning finding those patterns are much easier [2] (https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.069901). At this report, I wanted to do the same research and create an algorithm to find the most efficient cutting patterns for the relevant 3-dimensional shape, and reached above 90% efficiency.
